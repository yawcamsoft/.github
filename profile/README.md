<p>Yawcam (Yet Another WebCAM software) is created to let Windows users use their webcam (or IP camera) for streaming video, capturing snapshots, motion detection, and optionally sharing streams over the internet via built-in web server or FTP. It aims to be simple and accessible while providing full-featured webcam utilities.</p>

<h2>Core Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Live video streaming from webcam or DV-camera.</li>
<li>Image snapshots (single pictures) and time-lapse or periodic capture.</li>
<li>Motion detection: when movement is detected — automatic snapshot or other action.</li>
<li>Built-in web server: allows streaming or sharing webcam feed over HTTP to other devices.</li>
<li>FTP upload: captured images or videos can be uploaded automatically to remote server.</li>
<li>Overlays: ability to add text or image overlays on video or snapshots (e.g. watermark, timestamp).</li>
<li>Scheduling: you can set times to start/stop streaming or capturing automatically.</li>
<li>Password protection: restrict access to webcam stream via password.</li>
<li>Multi-language support.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Unique Characteristics / Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completely free to use (freeware).</li>
<li>Lightweight and relatively small size (~5.1 MB installer).</li>
<li>No need for complex or paid surveillance software to set up basic webcam live-streaming or motion detection.</li>
<li>Versatile output options (local file saving, streaming, FTP upload, web server) — suits different user needs.</li>
<li>Ability to run even old webcams or cameras supported by Windows, thanks to Java-based webcam interface.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users who want to use a webcam for home surveillance or simple security monitoring.</li>
<li>People needing a lightweight, free tool for remote webcam streaming or snapshots.</li>
<li>Users who want motion detection without investing in dedicated security cameras or paid software.</li>
<li>Hobbyists, home-office users, small businesses or anyone who wants to repurpose a webcam for monitoring or remote viewing.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technical Requirements & Supported Platforms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Operates on Windows (supports Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, 11) and earlier.</li>
<li>Requires Java (software is written in Java), so Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed.</li>
<li>Supports most webcams or video capture devices recognized by Windows (or IP cameras via URL configuration).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Typical Use Cases & Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a home security webcam: use webcam + Yawcam motion detection + FTP/image snapshot to monitor a room or entrance.</li>
<li>Remote webcam streaming: stream webcam feed over HTTP to share video with friends or family or remote monitoring.</li>
<li>Time-lapse photography: capture snapshots periodically to create time-lapse sequences.</li>
<li>Temporary surveillance or monitoring without buying hardware: use existing webcam + software.</li>
<li>Webcam server for small projects, DIY home surveillance, small office monitoring, or remote observation.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation & Setup Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download Yawcam from the official site.</li>
<li>Ensure Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed.</li>
<li>Run the Yawcam installer (or portable executable), launch Yawcam.</li>
<li>In settings, select appropriate video capture device (webcam or IP camera).</li>
<li>Choose desired output method(s): streaming (HTTP), snapshots, FTP upload, motion detection, etc.</li>
<li>Optionally configure overlays (text/image), schedule for start/stop or automatic capture, and enable password protection for streams.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Limitations & Known Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because software is Java-based, you need JRE installed (adds dependency).</li>
<li>Interface is somewhat dated / basic compared to modern webcam/surveillance tools.</li>
<li>Not primarily cloud-based: no built-in cloud storage or advanced remote management — for remote access you need your own server/FTP or open ports.</li>
<li>As with any webcam-based system, quality and reliability depend heavily on webcam hardware, lighting conditions, and network setup (for streaming).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Licensing & Distribution</h2>
<p>Yawcam is freeware — available free of charge.</p>


<h2>Recent Updates & Version Info</h2>
<p>Latest version is 0.8.0 (as of December 2023). There is also next-generation variant Yawcam Ai focused on video surveillance and object detection, alongside the classic Yawcam version.</p>


<h2>Why Yawcam</h2>
<p>Yawcam combines simplicity, flexibility and a rich set of webcam features — streaming, motion detection, snapshot, FTP upload, scheduling — into a free, lightweight tool. It is suitable for both casual users wanting a webcam utility, and for those setting up DIY monitoring or surveillance without complex infrastructure.</p>
